### File Descriptions

- **fizzBuzz.java**:  
  This file contains the solution to the classic FizzBuzz problem, where the program prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz", for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

- **Calculatrice Directory**:  
  This directory contains files that implement a basic calculator:
  - `calculatriceMain.java`: The main class that coordinates the operations of the calculator.
  - `Addition.java`: Handles addition operations.
  - `Multiplication.java`: Handles multiplication operations.
  - `Soustraction.java`: Handles subtraction operations.
  - `Division.java`: Handles division operations.

- **rectSeg Directory**:  
  This directory contains classes representing geometric shapes:
  - `Main.java`: The main class to execute operations on the shapes.
  - `Rectangle.java`: Defines the properties and behavior of a rectangle.
  - `Segment.java`: Defines the properties and behavior of a line segment.

- **addArgs Directory**:  
  This directory contains classes for summing arguments:
  - `add.java`: Calls two different classes for summing arguments.
  - `Option1.java`: Sums the arguments if all are numbers.
  - `Option2.java`: Sums the arguments and skips those that are not numbers.
